### This is tmux configuration I used, and if it suits to me, maybe can be usefull to you also :).

#### First, you need to install (for now) manualy tmux. If you have installed `brew` then it's easy, just run command:
> **brew** install tmux

#### if you dont then you can find more informations how to install it [here](https://gist.github.com/shrayasr/8714601).

#### If you are Ubuntu user, then you can run those commands to install tmux:
> **sudo** apt-get update

> **sudo** apt-get install tmux

#### All you need to do is to checkout this project to your HOME (~) directory using this command:
> **git** clone https://github.com/argethlam/.tmux ~/.tmux

#### After project checkout is finished you will need to add executable permission for `.tmux/install.sh` script.
chmod +x .tmux/install.sh

#### after that run script to finish setup and enjoy :).
